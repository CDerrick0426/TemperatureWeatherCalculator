# TemperatureWeatherCalculator

This is a calculator that, when given a Fahrenheit or Celsius input, will convert it to the other. It will also display a (randomly generated) value for precipitation and weather (cloudy, rain, clear, etc.), and it will finish by displaying a recommended clothing set (For example, if it's cold and rainy it will suggest a hoodie and umbrella)
