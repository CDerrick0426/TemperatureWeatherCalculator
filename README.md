# TemperatureWeatherCalculator

Our project scope was to learn and improve with some java features such as arrays and mathematical formulas by creating this calculator. 

This is a calculator that, when given a Fahrenheit or Celsius input, will convert it to the other. It also has functions to give a random weather and random temperature, as well as a function to generate a random clothing suggestion based off of the weather and temperature (For example, snow needs a heavy jacket due to the cold, rain needs a jacket, etc.)

A help menu is also accessible and gives information about each of these.

In order to use the program, please press all of the buttons and insert text where needed (In the temperature conversion file, below labels "Fahrenheit" and "Celsius". Consult the help menu if needed.

Classes: 

Main Screen GUI (CalculatorGUI.java): Chad Derrick

Help Menu (HelpMenu.GUI): Chad, Denah and Nicholas
Random Clothing Suggestor (ClothingMenu.java): Nicholas Day, GUI: Chad Derrick
Random Weather Generator (WeatherMenu.java): Denah Thach, GUI: Chad Derrick

Workload/Communication:
Workload in this project was fairly balanced between all three members. Each developed a full class, and Chad worked on the GUI as well as it was an easy task and allowed for a more consistent, albiet basic, design. Help menu was collaborated between all three to allow for better descriptions of each function. Communication was key and everyone communicated very well. Overall, a great group to work with.

Apache Netbeans was used to create and test the UI.

NOTE: All temperatures on ClothingMenu and WeatherMenu are in Fahrenheit.
